  <p>
    Much of my work has been involved with proprietary systems but I have always admired the Open Source movement, and in the past year I have tried to contribute back to the community.
  </p>

  <p>
    Creating these projects in my spare time allowed me to consolidate much of what I have learned while working with these technologies. I can now use these as a starting point for future projects, and hopefully someone in the community can either use it or learn from it as well.
  </p>


  <h2>Datos</h2>

  <a href="https://github.com/calderhayes/datos">GitHub</a>
  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/datos">NPM</a>

  <p>
    A simple ReactJS form utility to enable easy validation with minimal dependencies and written in TypeScript.
  </p>

  <p>
    Current solutions were not meeting my needs more my style. I ended up creating much of the components I required anyways, so I decided to make a simple utility until something more main stream meets my needs.
  </p>

  <h3>Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Minimal dependencies</li>
    <li>Built in TypeScript</li>
    <li>Allows for easy validation, and manual validation errors from server responses</li>
    <li>Using modern techniques</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Articulog</h2>

  <a href="https://github.com/calderhayes/articulog">GitHub</a>
  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/articulog">NPM</a>

  <p>
    A simple typescript/javascript logging wrapper. Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/net-commons/common-logging">Common Logging</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pimterry/loglevel">LogLevel</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/winstonjs/winston">Winston</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    I am very concerned about logging with most projects I work on. I wanted something that played nice with TypeScript, and could have granular control on what is logged and how it is logged.
  </p>
  <h3>Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Swappable typescript interface for logging</li>
    <li>Several log levels that can be adjusted dynamically</li>
    <li>Several categories of logs</li>
    <li>Allows for easy crafting of different log targets</li>
    <li>A top level control to allow for configuring of logs dynamically, and as a group</li>
    <li>Little to no dependencies (for simple logging)</li>
    <li>Useful for both browser and nodejs environments</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>SimpleFileControl</h2>

  <a href="https://github.com/calderhayes/simple-file-control">GitHub</a>
  <a href="https://preview.nuget.org/packages/SimpleFileControl/">NuGet</a>

  <p>
    I always seemed to recreate my file handlers by hand, and would usually couple them. It was always fine at first until I had a requirement change and would have to do a restructuring of the file control which usually was too coupled to the business logic.
  </p>
  <p>
    I then created this utility to have an adjustable underlying component where I could easily handle multiple file storage types under the same interface.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I decided to actually store this utility in its own repository and publish it as its own NuGet package, I discovered to my dismay the project <a href="https://github.com/visualeyes/cabinet">Cabinet</a>. It is more developed, larger community, more store implementations and has a cooler name.
  </p>
  <p>
    I decided to launch this anyways just because, but if you are looking for something more mature I would pass you off to them.
  </p>
  <h3>Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Handy interface for several different kinds of file storage methods</li>
    <li>Cross platform local disk store already implemented</li>
  </ul>
