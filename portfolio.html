          Much of my work has been involved with proprietary systems but I have always admired the Open Source movement, and in the past year I have tried to contribute back to the community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating these projects in my spare time allowed me to consolidate much of what I have learned while working with these technologies. I can now use these as a starting point for future projects, and hopefully someone in the community can either use it or learn from it as well.

        <p><t>.NET Core API Boilerplate</t><br/>
          <a href="https://github.com/calderhayes/dotnet-boilerplate">GitHub</a> <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
          I started with this project because I knew that any future projects I would like to participate in, I would be eager to use the upcoming .NET Core technology. It is fairly bleeding edge so it was difficult at first, but I really enjoy it and I look forward to its continuing maturity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried to include all of the best practices I can think of, and using only cross platform, and self contained technology (VS Code intead of VS Studio, PostreSQL instead of SQL Server). Docker was a real help to pull this off efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          This boilerplate template is nearing completion, and I hope to use it in my next project.
        </p>
        <h5>FEATURES</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Full cross platform, self contained to local machine for development</li>
          <li>Dockerfile for external systems: SMTP and PostgreSQL servers</li>
          <li>Full code warning analysis during build</li>
          <li>HangFire, SignalR (alpha version), EF Core, and all of the .NET Core ported libraries</li>
          <li>Unit testability</li>
          <li>Lots more</li>
        </ul>

        <p><t>ReactJS Flux Boilerplate</t><br/>
          <a href="https://github.com/calderhayes/react-boilerplate">GitHub</a> <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
          As a back-end preferred developer, I always found the NodeJS/JavaScript/NPM ecosystem to be a bit confusing and chaotic. I could get things up and running, but I never felt like I had things done properly, and often missed things that had to be wedged in later.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project began as an attempt to consolidate all the different things I had learned on the fly across all the different projects in which I used ReactJS.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a huge fan of the ReactJS technology, and the Flux data state patterns. The scalability and opinionated style really appeals to me. I also included various utilities that I found incredibly useful, such as Typescript, ImmutableJS, Webpack, and much more.
        </p>
        <h5>FEATURES</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Fully configured ReactJS app with Flux data state management</li>
          <li>Dependency Injection style for easy testability</li>
          <li>Static analysis through Typescript and tslint</li>
          <li>Swappable API layer to aid with developing through mock API calls</li>
          <li>Lots more</li>
        </ul>

        <p><t>SimpleFileControl</t><br/>
          <a href="https://github.com/calderhayes/simple-file-control">GitHub</a> <br/>
          <a href="https://preview.nuget.org/packages/SimpleFileControl/">NuGet</a> <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
          I always seemed to recreate my file handlers by hand, and would usually couple them. It was always fine at first until I had a requirement change and would have to do a restructuring of the file control which usually was too coupled to the business logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then created this utility to have an adjustable underlying component where I could easily handle multiple file storage types under the same interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I decided to actually store this utility in its own repository and publish it as its own NuGet package, I discovered to my dismay the project <a href="https://github.com/visualeyes/cabinet">Cabinet</a>. It is more developed, larger community, more store implementations and has a cooler name.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to launch this anyways just because, but if you are looking for something more mature I would pass you off to them.
        </p>
        <h5>FEATURES</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Handy interface for several different kinds of file storage methods</li>
          <li>Cross platform local disk store already implemented</li>
        </ul>
